# Project Structure for M2D (2D Physics Engine)

## Introduction
This document describes the file and folder structure for the M2D project, a 2D Physics Engine.

## Root Directory
- **README.MD**: Contains overall documentation and usage examples.
- **Project_Structure.MD**: This file, explaining the structure of the project.
- **main.py**: The entry point for running the physics simulation. This file integrates all the features into a main simulation loop.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python package dependencies.

### Folders
- **lib/**: Holds the core logic and algorithms for the physics engine.
- **gui/**: Holds the Tkinter-based GUI for visualizing the simulation. The GUI is handled by `gui_app.py`.
- **Agent_creature/**: Holds the AI agent creature model with movement, eating, and reproduction logic.

## Main Goals
1. Basic Particle System: Completed
2. Basic Forces and Motion: Completed
3. Basic Collision Detection: Completed
4. Constraints and Springs: To be implemented
5. Basic Creature Model: To be implemented
6. Food Spawn Model: To be implemented
7. AI Agent Creature: To be implemented
8. Basic GUI: Completed
9. Main Simulation Loop: Completed
10. Advanced Features and Optimizations: To be implemented
