M2D is a 2D physics engine designed to simulate physical interactions in a two-dimensional world. The engine is capable of handling collision detection, gravity, and simulating creature behavior as they search for food and evolve VIA AI Agent that can be modified.

## Features
- **Particle Systems**: Basic system for simulating particles with forces and motion. [Completed]
- **Collision Detection**: Basic collision detection between particles based on their radii. [Completed]
- **Forces and Motion**: Simulate real-world physics like gravity. [Completed]
- **Constraints**: Basic implementation of constraints like springs between particles. [To be implemented]
- **Creature Simulation**: Basic creature model with movement and eating behavior. [To be implemented]
- **Food Spawns**: Basic food spawn model with energy values and respawn logic. [To be implemented]
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Basic Tkinter-based GUI for visualizing the simulation. [Completed]
- **Agent Creature**: Basic AI agent creature model with movement, eating, and reproduction logic. [To be implemented]
- **Main Simulation**: Basic main simulation logic integrating all the above features. [Completed]
