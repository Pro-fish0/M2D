## Introduction

M2D is a 2D physics engine designed to simulate physical interactions in a two-dimensional world. The engine is capable of handling collision detection, gravity, and simulating creature behavior as they search for food and evolve.

## Features

- **Particle Systems**: Basic building blocks for more complex structures.
- **Collision Detection**: Accurate and efficient collision detection algorithms.
- **Forces and Motion**: Simulate real-world physics like gravity.
- **Constraints**: Limit movement or create joints between particles.
- **Creature Simulation**: Simulate creatures with specific abilities and goals.
- **Food Spawns**: Randomly spawn food items in the world.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A GUI to visualize the simulation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Some other libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
