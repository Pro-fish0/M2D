M2D is a 2D physics engine designed to simulate physical interactions in a two-dimensional world. The engine is capable of handling collision detection, gravity, and simulating creature behavior as they search for food and evolve VIA AI Agent that can be modified.

## Features
- **Particle Systems**: Basic system for simulating particles with forces and motion.
- **Collision Detection**: Basic collision detection between particles.
- **Forces and Motion**: Simulate real-world physics like gravity.
- **Constraints**: Basic constraints between particles.
- **Creature Simulation**: Basic simulation of creature behavior.
- **Food Spawns**: (To be implemented)
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Basic GUI for visualizing the simulation.
- **Agent Creature**: Basic implementation of agent creature behavior and simulation.
- **Math Utilities**: Basic mathematical utilities like dot product, vector magnitude, and normalization.
- **Core Physics**: Basic particle system with mass, position, and velocity.
